# MCC-Based Merchant Categorization Analysis

## üéØ Key Improvement: Using NPCI MCC Standards

Based on the [NPCI RuPay Merchant Category Code reference](https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/rupay/merchant-category-code), implementing MCC-based categorization will significantly improve merchant classification accuracy.

## üìä Current Situation Analysis

From the data exploration, I found:

1. **MCC Data Availability**: ~100% coverage
   - Direct `mcccode` column exists in the data
   - MCC codes also embedded in JSON fields within merchant/payee columns
   - Sample MCCs found: 5541 (gas stations), 4900 (utilities), 5812 (restaurants), 4814 (telecom), 5411 (grocery), etc.

2. **Current Name-based Issues**:
   - High "Others" category (~47.7% of transactions)
   - Inconsistent categorization of similar merchants
   - Difficulty categorizing smaller/regional merchants

## üí° Expected Improvements

Implementing MCC-based categorization should:

1. **Reduce "Others" category** from ~47.7% to likely <10%
2. **Improve accuracy** of merchant classification
3. **Enable better RFM analysis** with cleaner category distributions
4. **Standardize categorization** using industry standards
5. **Better segment high-value categories** like Government/Utilities (high transaction volume)

## üîß Implementation Strategy

1. **Extract MCC codes** from multiple columns:
   - Direct `mcccode` column
   - JSON embedded codes in `merchant`, `payee`, `payeeparticulars`

2. **Apply NPCI mapping** to create standardized categories:
   - Food & Dining (5812, 5814, 5813, 5811, 5462)
   - Grocery & Supermarkets (5411, 5499, 5441)
   - Fuel & Transportation (5541, 4111, 4112, 4121, 4214)
   - Government & Utilities (9399, 4900)
   - Healthcare & Medical (8062, 5912, 5047, etc.)
   - And 10+ other precise categories

3. **Maintain fallback** to name-based categorization for edge cases

## üìà Business Impact

This will enable:
- **More precise user segmentation** by actual spending categories
- **Better recommendation targeting** based on industry-standard categories
- **Improved RFM analysis** with cleaner category distributions
- **Regulatory compliance** with NPCI standards
- **Better cross-category insights** for banking/fintech analysis
